I was trying to install a new realtek driver for my laptop, so I went to the realtek official website and install one.
But it isn't suitable for the linux kernel version or something else error, then my LAN driver crashed (it had been deleted).
So the solution is 
```
  lspci    # check the Ethernet hardware id
  sudo apt-get install r8168-dkms
```
