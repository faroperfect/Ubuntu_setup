When using the .run file downloaded from NVIDIA offical website, it will report an error that YOU SHOULD TURN OFF X SERVER or something like that.
As a solution, refer to https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-exit-the-x-server-to-install-the-nvidia-driver/222361
"GataJapa" he or she 's answer:
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-515
//515 could be any other version number
//you can use ' apt-cache search nvidia-driver ' to find out which version you want.
